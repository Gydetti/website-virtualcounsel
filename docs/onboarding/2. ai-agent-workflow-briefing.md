## 🔄 **MANDATORY 3-STEP WORKFLOW**

### **STEP 1: Complete System Understanding & Validation** ⚡
**Objective:** Achieve deep, comprehensive understanding of the entire template system before making any changes.

**Actions Required:**
1. **Read the complete codebase technical guide (`docs/onboarding/3. codebase-technical-guide.md`)**
2. **Study the core configuration files:**
   - `lib/site.config.local.ts` - Master configuration and theme system
   - `lib/theme.variants.ts` - Theme variant definitions
   - `lib/data/staticContent.ts` - All placeholder content
   - `app/layout.tsx` - Theme injection and global setup
   - `components/layout/DynamicPageRenderer.tsx` - Page composition system

3. **Validate current system integrity:**
   ```bash
   npm run verify:local
   ```
   - Must pass with ZERO errors before proceeding
   - If any issues exist, document them and fix before continuing

4. **Review visual references:**
   - Study all screenshots in `docs/onboarding/example-screenshots-preview/`
   - Understand the visual structure and design patterns of template pages

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Do not proceed to Step 2 until you can confidently explain:
- How the theme system works and injects CSS variables
- How sections are composed and rendered dynamically
- How content is structured and validated
- How the testing and build pipeline functions
- Why specific patterns exist (button hover effects, text color layers, etc.)

---

### **STEP 2: Client Analysis & Blueprint Creation** 🎨
**Objective:** Analyze all client materials and create a comprehensive customization blueprint.

**Actions Required:**
1. **Read all client input files in `docs/onboarding/client-input-files/`:**
   - Text files, requirements documents, brand guidelines
   - Existing website screenshots or references
   - Any specific instructions or preferences
   - Business context, industry, target audience information
   - **⚠️ IMAGES:** Check for images in `docs/onboarding/client-input-files/images/` - if the folder is empty or doesn't exist, images will be provided later in the process

2. **🚨 CRITICAL IMAGE WORKFLOW UNDERSTANDING:**
   - **Website build comes FIRST, images come LATER**
   - **NEVER create, generate, or make up fake images**
   - **ALWAYS maintain existing placeholder images during initial build**
   - **Client images will be added to `docs/onboarding/client-input-files/images/` when ready**
   - **Only replace placeholders when real client images are provided**

3. **Create comprehensive client blueprint in `docs/onboarding/blueprint-plan-client-codebase-profile.md`:**
   - Complete all sections with specific, actionable information
   - Include technical implementation plan
   - Document quality assurance approach
   - Plan realistic timeline and risk mitigation

4. **Document potential challenges and solutions:**
   - Identify any non-standard requirements
   - Plan workarounds for edge cases
   - Note any custom development needs

**⚠️ VALIDATION:** The blueprint must be comprehensive enough that any AI assistant could execute the plan without additional context.

---

### **STEP 3: Enhanced Context & Guidelines Integration** 📚
**Objective:** Incorporate any additional instructions and guidelines that enhance the customization quality.

**Actions Required:**
1. **Read all files in `docs/onboarding/extra-instructions-guidelines/`:**
   - Tone of voice guidelines
   - Industry-specific requirements
   - Legal/compliance considerations
   - Any custom development patterns

2. **Read current agent handover notes in `docs/onboarding/agent-work-handover-notes.md`:**
   - Understand current project status and any ongoing work
   - Check for known issues or technical debt
   - Review any patterns or lessons learned from previous agents
   - Note any urgent or high-priority items

3. **Update the blueprint with enhanced guidelines:**
   - Integrate tone of voice into content strategy
   - Apply industry-specific best practices
   - Document any special compliance requirements

4. **Prepare for execution phase:**
   - Validate all prerequisites are met
   - Ensure understanding of client requirements
   - Confirm technical feasibility of all planned changes

## 🚀 **EXECUTION PHASE: Autonomous Implementation**

After completing the 3-step workflow, proceed with systematic implementation:

### **Phase A: Configuration & Theme Setup** ⚙️
1. **Update core configuration (`lib/site.config.local.ts`):**
   - Business information and branding
   - Theme variant selection and customizations
   - Feature flags and page enablement
   - Third-party service configurations

2. **Content migration:**
   - Replace placeholder content in `lib/data/staticContent.ts`
   - Update all meta-instructional copy with real content
   - Ensure content follows established patterns and best practices

3. **🖼️ Asset pipeline (IMAGES COME LATER):**
   - **🚨 DO NOT replace placeholder images during initial build**
   - **🚨 DO NOT create, generate, or make up fake images**
   - **✅ MAINTAIN existing placeholder images from `public/images/placeholders/`**
   - **📁 Client images will be provided later in `docs/onboarding/client-input-files/images/`**
   - **⏳ Image optimization workflow (`npm run image-optimize`) will be executed only when real client images are available**

### **Phase B: Validation & Quality Assurance** ✅
1. **Mandatory testing workflow:**
   ```bash
   npm run verify:local
   ```
   - Must pass with zero errors
   - Fix any issues immediately

2. **Visual quality assurance:**
   - Test all pages in different viewport sizes
   - Validate theme consistency across all sections
   - Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
   - Verify performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)

3. **Content quality review:**
   - Spell check and grammar review
   - SEO optimization validation
   - Call-to-action effectiveness
   - Brand consistency check

### **Phase C: Deployment & Documentation** 🚀
1. **Staging deployment:**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Conduct comprehensive smoke testing
   - Document any issues and resolutions

2. **Production deployment:**
   - Push to main branch (triggers auto-deployment)
   - Monitor deployment for issues
   - Validate live site functionality

3. **Client documentation:**
   - Create client-specific documentation
   - Update maintenance procedures
   - Provide training materials if needed
   - **📝 Document image requirements:** Note in handover that client images should be placed in `docs/onboarding/client-input-files/images/` for future optimization

4. **🔄 MANDATORY: Update agent handover notes (`docs/onboarding/agent-work-handover-notes.md`):**
   - Document all work completed in this session
   - Update project status and technical state
   - Note any issues discovered or lessons learned
   - Update priority queue for next agent
   - Document any new patterns or best practices discovered
   - **📋 Image status:** Document whether client images are pending and expected location

---

## 🛡️ **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **Quality Gates (Never Skip These):**
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm run verify:local`)
- ✅ Zero console errors or warnings
- ✅ Lighthouse scores maintain/improve baseline
- ✅ All pages load correctly in multiple browsers
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness validated
- ✅ Accessibility compliance confirmed
- ✅ **Placeholder images maintained (no fake/generated images)**

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- 🚫 Skipping the full system understanding (Step 1)
- 🚫 Making changes without running tests first
- 🚫 Hardcoding colors or values instead of using theme system
- 🚫 Breaking existing patterns for "custom" solutions
- 🚫 Deploying without comprehensive validation
- 🚫 **Creating, generating, or making up fake images**
- 🚫 **Replacing placeholder images before client images are provided**
- 🚫 **Assuming images are available when `docs/onboarding/client-input-files/images/` is empty**

### **Emergency Procedures:**
- **If tests fail:** Stop immediately, analyze logs, fix issues before proceeding
- **If deployment fails:** Investigate immediately, prepare rollback if needed
- **If client requirements seem impossible:** Document clearly and escalate
