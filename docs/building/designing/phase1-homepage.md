Here’s a step-by-step roadmap for evolving our homepage template from its current draft into the optimal, research-driven version. We’ll break it into three phases—Structure, Design/UX, and Copy—while weaving in our build-and-deploy workflow at every checkpoint.

1. Kick-off & Branch Strategy  
   a. Create a feature branch (e.g. `feature/homepage-structure`).  
   b. Install any missing dependencies and verify local dev server is running:  
      • `npm install && npm run dev`.  

2. Phase 1: Scaffold the Structure  
   a. Identify and isolate each major section as its own component under `components/sections/`:  
      - `HeroSection.tsx`  
      - `ValuePropSection.tsx`  
      - `SocialProofSection.tsx`  
      - `ProblemPainSection.tsx`  
      - `SolutionVisionSection.tsx`  
      - `CTASection.tsx`  
      - `ServicesOverviewSection.tsx`  
      - `BlogPreviewSection.tsx`  
      - `ContactSection.tsx`  
   b. In each file:  
      - Export a TypeScript interface for its props (e.g. headlines, bullets, lists, images, CTA text/links).  
      - Provide stub/default props so the page compiles and renders with placeholders.  
      - Wrap each in a semantic `<section aria-labelledby="…">` with a unique `id`.  
   c. In `app/page.tsx`, import and render the new components in the correct order:  
      Hero → ValueProp → SocialProof → ProblemPain → SolutionVision → CTA → ServicesOverview → BlogPreview → Contact.  
   d. Run our internal checks:  
      • `npm run build` (must compile)  
      • `npm run lint -- --fix` & `npm run lint` (zero warnings/errors)  
      • `npm test` (all tests pass or no tests)  
      → Commit with message: `feat(homepage): scaffold all sections with stub props`.

3. Phase 2: Basic Design & UX Polish  
   a. Flesh out each section’s Tailwind layout to mirror the F-pattern and scannability guidelines:  
      - Hero: two-column grid, left text, right visual.  
      - ValueProp: two-column panels with outcome lists.  
      - SocialProof: horizontal logo grid or lightweight carousel.  
      - Testimonials: centered carousel card with pagination dots.  
      - Pain & Solution: alternating background colors to distinguish “before/after”.  
      - CTA: full-width, contrasting background.  
      - ServicesOverview: three-card grid with one highlighted.  
      - BlogPreview: three-column card layout with consistent image ratio.  
      - Contact: two-column form + info card.  
   b. Add responsive breakpoints, spacing, and typography tokens (from `tailwind.config.ts`).  
   c. Verify accessibility landmarks and keyboard/tab flow.  
   d. Rerun build, lint, and tests.  
   e. Commit: `style(homepage): add core layout and responsive styles`.

4. Phase 3: Wire in Placeholder Copy & Data Hooks  
   a. Draft placeholder text in each component, pulled straight from the brief headings (“Headline here”, “Subheadline here”, sample bullets).  
   b. Add Prop drilling or a JSON fixture under `lib/data/homepage.ts` to centralize content (so designers can tweak one file).  
   c. Pass that data into each section via props.  
   d. Validate that each section properly renders dynamic content.  
   e. Build/lint/test again.  
   f. Commit: `feat(homepage): wire placeholder content via data fixtures`.

5. Phase 4: Design QA & Fine-Tuning  
   a. Spin up staging preview and compare side-by-side against the research brief’s wireframe:  
      - Ensure CTAs appear at all recommended breakpoints.  
      - Check scannability (heading hierarchy, bullet spacing, icon usage).  
      - Validate trust signals (logos, testimonials) are prominent.  
   b. Tweak colors, hover states, and iconography. Pull in high-quality placeholder visuals.  
   c. Check performance (Lighthouse scores) and accessibility (axe).  
   d. Build/lint/test and deploy to staging again.  
   e. Commit: `refactor(homepage): polish UX, adjust spacing/colors`.

6. Phase 5: Final Copy Integration  
   a. Collect real or AI-drafted copy for each section (using our “Gather Client Information” prompt).  
   b. Replace fixture text with actual copy. Review copy against brief for alignment (tone, structure, CTAs).  
   c. Conduct a final proofreading pass and ensure consistency (CTA text identical everywhere).  
   d. Build/lint/test and deploy to staging.  
   e. Commit: `chore(homepage): integrate final AI copy`.

7. Merge & Go-Live  
   a. Create a Pull Request from `feature/homepage-structure` → `main`.  
   b. CI will run build, lint, and tests automatically.  
   c. After approval and zero CI errors, merge to `main`. Vercel auto-deploys the live site.  
   d. Celebrate! 🎉

Throughout each phase, we never skip our build → lint → test → (staging) → commit → push cycle, and we’ll always keep our `main` branch in a deployable state. Let me know which phase you’d like to start on (or if you’d like to refine the plan further)!
