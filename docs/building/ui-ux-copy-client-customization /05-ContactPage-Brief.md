### 2. Short and Easy Form (`Component: ContactForm` - Field Configuration)

*   **Goal:** Maximize form completion rates by minimizing effort and requesting only essential information.

    *   **Essential Fields Only:** Configure the form to include only necessary fields (typically: Name, Email, Message). Consider Phone (optional) or a simple "Interested In" dropdown if crucial for routing.
    *   **Avoid:** Unnecessary fields like full address, company size (unless essential for service), "How did you hear about us?" (ask later).
    *   **Clarity:** Ensure clear labels for each field. Use placeholder text helpfully (e.g., "Tell us a bit about your project or question").
    *   **Required Fields:** Mark only absolutely essential fields as required.
    *   **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure fields are large, easily tappable, and trigger appropriate mobile keyboards (text, email, phone).
    *   **Multi-Step (If Necessary):** If a longer form is unavoidable for qualification, configure it as a multi-step form to feel less daunting.
