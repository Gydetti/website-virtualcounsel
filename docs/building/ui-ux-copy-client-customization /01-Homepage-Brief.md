## Consolidated Research Brief: Homepage

**Overall Purpose:**
*   Serve as the website's first impression and primary conversion hub.
*   Orient visitors, even those landing elsewhere first.
*   Capture attention within seconds (<15 seconds).
*   Immediately convey **Who** you serve, **What** problem you solve, and **Why** it matters (core value proposition).
*   Follow a logical narrative flow guiding the visitor from understanding to action (e.g., Problem -> Stakes -> Solution -> Proof -> CTA).
*   Answer the visitor's core questions: "Is this for me? Can I trust this? What should I do next?"

**General Design Principles:**
*   **F-Shaped Pattern:** Place most important messages and CTAs towards the top and left side.
*   **Scannability:** Use headings, subheadings, short paragraphs, bullet points, and visual separators. Avoid "walls of text".
*   **Clean Design:** Ensure a professional, uncluttered look that supports clarity and credibility.

### 1. Hero Section (`Component: HeroSection`)

*   **Goal:** Instant clarity on Value Proposition (What, Who, Why) "above the fold". Must pass the "five-second test".
*   **Key Principles:** Benefit-driven, concise, clear, specific, avoids jargon.
*   **AI TASK - Content Implementation:**
    *   **Headline (H1):** Edit H1 tag. Must clearly state the service, target audience, and primary benefit/outcome.
        *   *Research Example:* "Marketing coaching for busy realtors – attract more clients in less time."
    *   **Sub-headline:** Edit sub-headline tag. Should concisely expand on the H1, adding context or a secondary benefit.
    *   **Visual:** Ensure a relevant, high-quality visual (image/video) is implemented. Guidance: Should reinforce the core message or show the client/outcome.
    *   **Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) Button:**
        *   Edit button text: Use clear, action-oriented, benefit-focused language (e.g., "Book My Free Consultation", "Get Started Today", "Download Your Free Guide"). Avoid generic "Submit".
        *   Edit button link: Point to the primary conversion goal (e.g., Contact page, scheduling tool).
        *   Ensure prominence (Design via CSS): Visually distinct (contrast color), placed clearly above the fold.

    *   **Structure:** Use bullet points, icons with text, or distinct content blocks for key benefits/differentiators.
    *   **Content:** For each point, translate service features into client benefits. Focus on tangible results or improvements.
        *   *Research Example (Benefit > Feature):* Instead of "Includes 5 coaching sessions," use "Achieve [Specific Outcome] in 5 focused coaching sessions."
    *   **Differentiator:** Ensure at least one point clearly states what makes the service unique (e.g., unique methodology, specific expertise, niche focus).
    *   **Scannability:** Use short phrases or clear subheadings for each benefit (e.g., "Save Time," "Personalized Strategy," "Proven Results").

    *   **Button Text:** Edit text to be action-oriented and benefit-focused (e.g., "Book My Free Consult," "Get Coaching Help Now," "Request Your Quote").
