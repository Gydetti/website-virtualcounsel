### 1. Authentic and Specific Testimonials (`Component: TestimonialItem` - _Repeat or map to dynamic data_)

- **Goal:** Showcase genuine client feedback that highlights concrete results and positive experiences. Maximize credibility.
- **Key Principles:** Authenticity, specificity, tangibility. Real names/photos significantly increase trust.
- **AI TASK - Content Implementation (For each testimonial):**
  - **Quote:** Edit/insert the client's actual words. Focus on quotes mentioning specific outcomes, transformations, or quantifiable results.
    - _Research Example (Specific > Generic):_ "After 6 coaching sessions, I landed 3 new clients..." is better than "Great coaching!"
  - **Attribution:** **Crucially include (with permission):**
    - Client's Full Name
    - Client's Photo (professional headshot preferred)
    - Client's Title/Business/Location (adds context and relatability)
  - **Formatting:** Use clear visual cues (quotation marks, distinct text styling) for the quote. Ensure consistent format for all testimonials.

### 2. Range of Outcomes / Use Cases (`Component: TestimonialList / Filtering Logic`)

- **Goal:** Demonstrate broad applicability and success across different client types or service areas. Allow prospects to find stories relevant to their specific situation.
- **Key Principles:** Representation, relatability. Organization aids navigation if many testimonials exist.
- **AI TASK - Content Strategy & Implementation:**

### 4. Visual Consistency and Emphasis (`Handled via Component Structure & CSS`)

- **Key Principles:** Readability, scannability, consistency in design. Bold key phrases for scanners.

### 5. Volume and Currency (`Content Selection Strategy`)

- **Goal:** Indicate consistent success and current relevance. Avoid appearing outdated or having limited proof.
- **Key Principles:** Sufficient quantity builds confidence (more than 1-2 needed). Recent testimonials show ongoing effectiveness. Quality over quantity if necessary.
- **AI TASK - Content Strategy Input & Implementation:**
  - **Quantity:** Advise including a reasonable number (e.g., 5-10+, depending on availability) to demonstrate consistent results. Avoid filler.
  - **Recency:** Prioritize including testimonials from recent years (e.g., add "‚Äì Client since 2024" or similar if possible). Ensure dates are shown if using blog-style case studies.
  - **Updates:** Note the need for the client to provide new testimonials periodically to keep the page fresh.

### 6. Diverse Formats (Optional Enhancements) (`Component: VideoTestimonialEmbed`, `Component: RatingHighlight`)
