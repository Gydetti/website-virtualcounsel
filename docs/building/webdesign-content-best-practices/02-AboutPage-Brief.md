### 2. Story (Authenticity and Empathy) (`Component: AboutStory`)

*   **Goal:** Connect on a human level by sharing the authentic professional journey or business origin story. Build liking and relatability.
*   **Key Principles:** Authenticity, transparency, customer-relevance (link story to *how* it makes you better for the client), personable tone (use "I" or "we"). Cialdini's Liking principle.
*   **AI TASK - Content Implementation:**
    *   **Narrative:** Edit the main text block to tell a genuine story. Focus on:

### 4. Face to the Name (Visual Trust) (`Component: AboutPhotos / within other sections`)

*   **Goal:** Build connection and trust by showing the real people behind the business. Reinforce legitimacy.

### 5. Values & Philosophy (`Component: AboutValues`)

*   **Goal:** Attract clients who align with the business's core values and approach. Differentiate on a deeper level. Address the "philosophical problem" (StoryBrand).

*   **AI TASK - Content Implementation:**
    *   **Statement/List:** Edit text to clearly state core values or guiding philosophy. Can be a short list or a brief paragraph.

### 6. Social Proof / Micro-Trust Signals (`Component: AboutSocialProof_Snippet`)

*   **Goal:** Reinforce credibility subtly on the About page itself, complementing the main story.

*   **AI TASK - Content Implementation (Optional):**
    *   **Testimonial Snippet:** Consider adding one short, relevant quote focused on the *experience* of working with the professional/team.
        *   *Research Example:* "Jane’s coaching was not only strategic but also incredibly supportive..." – [Client Name]
