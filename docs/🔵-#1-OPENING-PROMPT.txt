Please Read all the following files. 

Core onboarding file:
@master-client-onboarding.md = docs/master-client-onboarding.md

And also, explain me the rules that you have attached with you here! Let's see if you know them properly.
As a reminder: always run the build + test actions after making significant changes:
* be proactive in your work, you do need to report on me if there are issues or if you decide to apply quick fixes or temporary solutions, then you need to report in with me.
Else, I trust your guidence and you are the expert to work as a professional.
Remember: you are on auto-mode meaning you will proceed with taking actions. This can result in you going down a path we don't want if you have too much tunnelvision. Be aware of that.

And understand the codebase that we're working on @gmg-template-website-2025. I'll share more information/instructions in the next prompts!

There is one key thing you are always forgetting: that is the importance of testing your own work after making significatn changes. SO PLEASE, REMEMBER THIS TIME TO RUN ALL THE TESTS AND CHECKS after a few code changes!!
