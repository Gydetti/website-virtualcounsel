Please Read all the following files. 

Core onboarding file:
@master-client-onboarding.md = docs/master-client-onboarding.md

And also, explain me the rules that you have attached with you here! Let's see if you know them properly.
As a reminder: always run the build + test actions after making significant changes:
* be proactive in your work, you do need to report on me if there are issues or if you decide to apply quick fixes or temporary solutions, then you need to report in with me.
Else, I trust your guidence and you are the expert to work as a professional.
Remember: you are on auto-mode meaning you will proceed with taking actions. This can result in you going down a path we don't want if you have too much tunnelvision. Be aware of that.

And understand the codebase that we're working on @gmg-template-website-2025. I'll share more information/instructions in the next prompts!

There is one key thing you are always forgetting: that is the importance of testing your own work after making significatn changes. SO PLEASE, REMEMBER THIS TIME TO RUN ALL THE TESTS AND CHECKS after a few code changes!!




--------------------


Great work! Please proceed with the plan and where you left off. Always remember the plan and what we're working on here! Thanks.

You are now operating as my expert design-focused front-end developer with deep expertise in React, Next.js, and design systems. Your task is to implement the design enhancement blueprint detailed in docs/building/designing/phase7-finaltrydesigningupgrade.md.

CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING: Before making any changes, analyze:
   - The theme system architecture (CSS variables + Tailwind integration)
   - The component hierarchy and data flow patterns
   - The animation system (LazySection + Framer Motion)
   - How the configuration-driven approach works (site.config â†’ section rendering)

2. CONFIGURATION-FIRST APPROACH:
   - Always implement visual changes through the theme configuration system
   - Add new visual options, that fit with the dynamic styling, to site.config.local.ts, NOT as hardcoded values in components.
   - It is ok to hardcode certain things that need to be hardcoded of course, but if it's like theme/template/boilerplate customisation things, then take that into account. 
   - Follow the pattern of using CSS variables or Tailwind classes derived from config
   - Ensure all new styling options have proper schema validation

3. TESTING PROTOCOL:
   - Test IMMEDIATELY after implementing a new pattern/approach for the first time
   - Run full verification (`npm run verify:local`) after completing logical groupings of changes
   - Verify changes across multiple sections to confirm consistency
   - Check responsive behavior on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports

4. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - Update the implementation status section of phase7-finaltrydesigningupgrade.md after each batch of work
   - Add any discovered gotchas, patterns or important learnings to a "Implementation Learnings" section
   - Document all new configuration options with clear comments
   - Note any future enhancement opportunities that arise during implementation

5. IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE:
   - Start with core visual foundations (typography, spacing, shadows, animations)
   - Then enhance base UI components (buttons, cards, sections)
   - Next, apply improvements to specific sections (hero, testimonials, CTA)
   - Finally, fine-tune responsive behavior and animations

After each meaningful batch of changes, provide a concise update including:
1. What specific parts of the design blueprint you've implemented
2. Any challenges encountered and how you solved them
3. Any new patterns or gotchas that should be documented
4. What's next in your implementation plan

It's crucial and to your core right now that you understand where we are at the process. You understand and review all the steps about what has been done, what has been completed, and all the next steps. The document might be a little bit outdated, so you also validate the point that you're starting on. Like if the previous work has been really done, and if the work that you're going to do hasn't been done already. You're also self-controlling here (self-correcting). Thank you. 

Please proceed with phase 7 implementation, maintaining the project's commitment to configurability, performance, and visual excellence.
