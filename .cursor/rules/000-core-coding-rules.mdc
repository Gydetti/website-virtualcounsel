# Build and Deployment Workflow Rule

Always perform the following steps on any code changes before pushing to the `main` branch:

1. **Internal Build**: Run `npm run build` (or your build command) to ensure the application compiles without errors.
2. **Linter Tests**: Run `npm run lint` and resolve **all** errors and warnings.
3. **Internal Deployment**: Deploy to a staging environment (e.g., `npm run deploy -- --target staging`) or local environment to validate runtime behavior.

After all checks pass with **zero errors** and no regressions or bugs:

5. **Git Push**: Commit any remaining changes and push to the `main` branch. The `main` branch is always live.
6. **Auto-Deployment to Vercel**: Pushing to `main` triggers an automatic deployment workflow on Vercel.

_Do not skip any step in this workflowâ€”ensuring a fully functional, bug-free codebase is mandatory before going live._
