# Build and Deployment Workflow Rule

Always perform the following steps on any code changes before pushing to the `main` branch:

1. **Internal Build**: Run `npm run build` (or your build command) to ensure the application compiles without errors.  
2. **ESLint Tests**: Run `npm run lint` and resolve **all** errors and warnings.  
2a. Optional --> When we're really working on the optimised codebase **Biome Linter Tests**: Run `npx biome check app components lib hooks .` (or `npm run biome:lint`) and resolve **all** warnings and errors. If it is just for making sure everythign is pushed to Git and deployed to Vercel then ignore this. The Biome check is often a best practice note but not mandatory for deployment.
3. **Internal Deployment**: Deploy to a staging environment (e.g., `npm run deploy`) or local environment to validate runtime behavior.  

After all checks pass with **zero errors** and no regressions or bugs:

4. **Git Push**: Commit any remaining changes and push to the `main` branch. The `main` branch is always live.  
5. **Auto-Deployment to Vercel**: Pushing to `main` triggers an automatic deployment workflow on Vercel.

_Do not skip any step in this workflowâ€”ensuring a fully functional, bug-free codebase is mandatory before going live._
