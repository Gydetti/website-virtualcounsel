And also, explain me the rules that you have attached with you here! Let's see if you know them properly.
As a reminder: always run the build + test actions after making significant changes: be proactive in your work, you do need to report on me if there are issues or if you decide to apply quick fixes or temporary solutions: then you need to report in with me.
Else, I trust your guidence and you are the expert to work as a professional.
